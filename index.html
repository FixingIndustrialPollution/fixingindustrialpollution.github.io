                <h4 class="text">Groups give different thoughts in the case of industrial pollution. These thoughts induce indifference in helping reduce climate change. Pollution became widely known in the 90’s, and ever since has been growing at an exponential rate. However when the air quality took a turn for the worse, the levels of pollution became much more visible. When the air quality decreased people also reacted. Over the last few years Germany has been focusing on diesel emissions. Although this concern is primarily focused towards consumer vehicles, the industry is also affected. Factories are going to have to rethink the way they transport their products on a local scale, and in some cases, how they power their factories. Factories having to change how they power their plants isn’t as likely as them having to change how they transport their products. Nowadays, however, most factories run on electricity and only resort to diesel fuel to run their generators in the case of a power outage. After the pollution problem was brought to attention, it has seemed to grow exponentially. In reality this is mostly caused by the press, however it is still becoming an increasingly large problem every day. The emissions caused by these engines cause the population hundreds of billions of dollars in medical bills. In conclusion, industrial pollution, specifically air pollution, is becoming a huge deal in Germany. All the major industries are affected by this however Germany has put its resource towards solving this problem on a consumer scale. </h4>

                <h1 class="s trans">An analysis of the problem: </h1>
                <h4 class="text">Different groups have very different agendas to attend to. In the case of industrial pollution, these agendas can come into play—some groups are promoting industrial manufacturing, and others are supporting policies that suppress pollution. In China, Big business owners (such as Foxconn) are wanting more factories, and less government oversight. The Chinese government has begun to succumb to the pressure which other countries and organizations are laying on it, and are beginning to implement environmental protection policies. However, they are also somewhat reluctant to commit to these policies, seeing as the SEZ’s have brought them huge economic benefit in the form of the manufacturing industry. While in Germany, the government used to not require diesel cars to have filters, but now the users are mandated to. Also, in the US, the new administration is rolling back the “aggressive” climate policies. They have states on multiple occasions that they regard job creation as more important than climate change. They have stated that they believe that climate change is a hoax. Three different problems in three different countries make something clear: one side wants change, and the other does not. In order to reduce the effects of climate change, we must take action, and enact more policies.                    </h4>
