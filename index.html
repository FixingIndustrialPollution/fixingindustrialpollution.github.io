                <h4 class="text">Groups give different thoughts in the case of industrial pollution. These thoughts induce indifference in helping reduce climate change. Pollution became widely known in the 90’s, and ever since has been growing at an exponential rate. However when the air quality took a turn for the worse, the levels of pollution became much more visible. When the air quality decreased people also reacted. Over the last few years Germany has been focusing on diesel emissions. Although this concern is primarily focused towards consumer vehicles, the industry is also affected. Factories are going to have to rethink the way they transport their products on a local scale, and in some cases, how they power their factories. Factories having to change how they power their plants isn’t as likely as them having to change how they transport their products. Nowadays, however, most factories run on electricity and only resort to diesel fuel to run their generators in the case of a power outage. After the pollution problem was brought to attention, it has seemed to grow exponentially. In reality this is mostly caused by the press, however it is still becoming an increasingly large problem every day. The emissions caused by these engines cause the population hundreds of billions of dollars in medical bills. In conclusion, industrial pollution, specifically air pollution, is becoming a huge deal in Germany. All the major industries are affected by this however Germany has put its resource towards solving this problem on a consumer scale. </h4>

                <h4 class="text">Different groups have very different agendas to attend to. In the case of industrial pollution, these agendas can come into play—some groups are promoting industrial manufacturing, and others are supporting policies that suppress pollution. In China, Big business owners (such as Foxconn) are wanting more factories, and less government oversight. The Chinese government has begun to succumb to the pressure which other countries and organizations are laying on it, and are beginning to implement environmental protection policies. However, they are also somewhat reluctant to commit to these policies, seeing as the SEZ’s have brought them huge economic benefit in the form of the manufacturing industry. While in Germany, the government used to not require diesel cars to have filters, but now the users are mandated to. Also, in the US, the new administration is rolling back the “aggressive” climate policies. They have states on multiple occasions that they regard job creation as more important than climate change. They have stated that they believe that climate change is a hoax. Three different problems in three different countries make something clear: one side wants change, and the other does not. In order to reduce the effects of climate change, we must take action, and enact more policies.                    </h4>

                                <p>Industrial manufacturing in China is a pivotal business on an international scale. This extensive manufacturing spawns extensive waste, and in this case, on a larger scale than anywhere else in the world. This is particularly true of large cities, but rural areas are also affected by the extraction of the materials that feed the factories. In 2015, China was reported to release over 25% of the world’s air pollutants.                                     </p>

                                <p>The country is mostly powered by burning coal, which is a major cause of the high pollution levels. In fact, China’s coal use accounts for around half of global coal usage worldwide. Cars are another major cause of pollution in China. China has upwards of 150 million cars on its roads, and due to the insane urban density, large cities experience unimaginable traffic jams. All of these stagnant cars release more and more gaseous pollutants. However, gaseous pollutants aren’t China’s only problems. It’s industrial waste runs into the water system, and heavily contaminates the water. The already-scarce water is squandered, and almost all of it is used in agriculture, and China’s coal industry. </p>

                                <p>China’s pollution levels are off the charts, especially in the eastern half. Pollution in Beijing has been reported to reach up to 40 times the World Health Organization’s acceptable limit. Over 25% of China’s numerous rivers were deemed unfit for human contact. 60% of groundwater near major cities is ranked “very bad.” China has stressed its water sources so badly that large swathes of the country are experiencing desertification. Over 1 million square miles of land is being affected, which will prove to be detrimental to over 4 million people. Air pollution is being attributed to over 1.2 million deaths annually. It has also been linked to respiratory, cardiovascular, and cerebrovascular diseases. Citizens are protesting on social media, The pollution levels in China are so immense that South Korea and Japan are reporting being affected by China’s pollution, and they’re affecting regions as far away California. </p>

                                <p>China’s government has created a five-year plan to reduce air pollution across the country. They plan to cut atmospheric particulate matter by 10% nationwide. More ambitious goals have been set for larger cities. The goal for Northern China (The Beijing Area) is to cut it by 25%; the goal for Shanghai and the Yangtze River Delta is 20%, and the goal for the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Bay Area is 15%. The government was planning on reducing the 2013 coal energy percentage of 70%, to 65% by the end of 2017%. They planned to reduce the release of PM2.5 particles by 15-20% by 2020. There is no information on whether they met the goal or not. They also plan to make at least 13% of their energy consumption come from a clean source. China has shut down thousands of factories in the name of this policy. However, many experts say that their plan is flawed. The better solution to the pollution crisis seems to be the numerous businessmen investing in wind and solar energy. </p>

                                        A connection has been made between the decline in the air quality and Diesel engines. 
                                        Germany keeps changing the limits for the percentage of harmful particles they allow.

                                <p>Emissions levels will drop which will automatically reduce air pollution. If there is nothing polluting the air, it won’t stay polluted. Over time it will gradually return to a much better condition.

                                        980 Billion Dollars per year is spent on medical treatment for illnesses related to the poor air quality.</p>

                                <p>Larger cities have been given permission to ban the use of Diesel engines.
                                        Germany is in the process of requiring engines to use particle filters.
                                        Right now Germany is own their own for improving air quality, but if the air quality doesn’t improve the EU is ready to step in and make it happen.
                                        The EU isn’t impressed with Germany’s air quality and openly voice their opinions.</p>

                                <p>The Obama administration implemented one of the most strict climate change policies any administration has done, and the new administration is trying to roll back some of this “aggressive” regulation. On the other hand, California has the strictest climate change rules in the country, which could land a legal battle between the Trump admin. and Jerry Brown. 
                                        The United States has recently started to assert that jobs are more important than the environment; a scapegoat for weak environmental policies. Though, some companies decided to make the US greener...at a price. They locate their manufacturing to countries with less regulations. </p>

                                <p>The legal battle between California and the Trump Administration stems from the fact that California will stick to the Climate Change policies that the Obama administration setup. Scott Pruitt, the EPA chief frames this as a “reprieve to the car manufacturers,” which will result in cheaper cars for consumers. California is still defiant. They say the the 1970 Clean Air Act gives them legal headway to enforce more strict climate laws. Xavier Becerra, California’s attorney general will do “everything we need to defend the process.” Pruitt also has set a line in the sand, and thinks that California “is not the arbiter of these issues.” He also stated that “they shouldn’t dictate what the rest of the country should do.” Donald Trump wants America to be “the car capital of the world,” and thinks that the EPA’s new regulations will help. 
                                        The moving of the manufacturing just relocates the pollution problem. 21% of production related emissions are from US exports.   </p>

                                <p>Trump is weakening greenhouse gas emissions which should give a win for car manufacturers.  Though, the legal battle might lead to car manufacturers making cars for California (and 12 other states) and the rest of the country.  The 12 other states represent 1/3 of the auto market.  This will split the nation into two car markets, which will result in different car designs.  Another party, the Competitive Enterprise Institute wants the EPA to act since “California will be facing unrealistic and costly mandates.” </p>

                                <p>To counteract the moving of the manufacturing plants, some uprisings over sweatshops and other places (Nike, Foxconn...) have occurred. A recurring idea is that we should reward companies for Social Responsibility to reduce the pollution. We could do this using trade agreements and United Nations’ policies. Leaders should focus on jobs that do not affect the environment.</p>
